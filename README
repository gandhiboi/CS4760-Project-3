ISSUES

- had issues with accessing shared memory; although strings from file are stored
  and accessed through shared memory, i was not able to access shared memory
  in coordinator.cpp when I was trying to write to file; as a result I stored the
  strings globally also so that I could output to the file
- similar issue to the child PIDs; I stored those globally rather than shared memory
  so I could write to the file
- signal handler is funky; sometimes it detaches/deletes shared memory and message queue,
  other times it does not; couldn't figure out a real solution; since it worked fine on
  my last project

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE

- "technically" everything is done according to specifications, but not as clean as I
  would have liked it to be; for example, I had to use globally stored strings and pids
  to be able to output to palin.out and nopalin.out

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HOW TO RUN

1. Type 'make' in the terminal
2. Run as './coordinator' followed by the options and file name; if no optinos are specified
   [-m] is set to default 20 and [-c] is set to m as default

   e.g.   ./coodinator -c 30 -m 5 dataFile  	or 	./coordinator dataFile

3. Type 'make clean' to remove executables, object files, and log files
